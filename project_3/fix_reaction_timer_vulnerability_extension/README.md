# fix_reaction_timer_vulnerability_extension
An improvement on the circuit for measuring a user's reaction time in approximately milliseconds that stops the timer
when maximum time limit (FF) is reached.  
This prevents users from taking advantage of overflow errors to record false shorter reaction times.
