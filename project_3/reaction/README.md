# reaction
A sequential circuit based on a Moore State machine that measures a user's reaction time in approximately milliseconds and
displays it as a two-digit hexadecimal number on two 7-segment displays.  
Upon pressing a `start` button, the circuit waits for about 3 seconds, turns on an LED and displays how fast it takes the user to push the `react` push button after the LED turns on.
