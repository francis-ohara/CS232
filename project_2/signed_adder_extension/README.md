# signed_adder_extension
A signed adder circuit for adding two signed 5-bit 2's complement numbers and displaying the results as an 8-bit unsigned number and sequence of bits for displaying the sign of the result.  
Two seven-segment displays are used to display the magnitude of the resulting sum and a third seven segment display is used to display a minus sign when the result is negative.
