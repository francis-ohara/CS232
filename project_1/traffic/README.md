# traffic
A circuit for simulating the behavior of a four-way traffic light system,
where one stop light controls traffic along the North-South road and another stop light controls traffic along the East-West road.  
The circuit consists of:
 - An up counter that increments based on push button presses, which is used to simulate the progression of time.
 - 2 push buttons: 1 for controlling the counter and another for resetting the circuit.
 - 6 LEDs for indicating which state each of the stop lights is in (Red, Yellow, Green).
